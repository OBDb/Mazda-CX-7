    description: "The Mazda CX-7 was introduced as a mid-size crossover SUV with sport sedan-inspired styling and driving dynamics, positioned between the compact CX-5 and three-row CX-9 in Mazda's lineup. The exterior featured a distinctive design with a steeply raked windshield, prominent fenders, and a sloping roofline creating a sporty profile unusual for SUVs of its era. Initially powered exclusively by a 2.3L turbocharged four-cylinder engine shared with the Mazdaspeed3, producing 244 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. In 2010, a naturally aspirated 2.5L four-cylinder engine with 161 horsepower was added as a more economical base option. The interior offered a driver-focused cockpit with a three-dial instrument cluster, sporty three-spoke steering wheel, and available features including leather seating, automatic climate control, Bose audio system, and navigation. Despite its mid-size exterior dimensions, the CX-7 featured a four-passenger-focused cabin with limited rear seat and cargo space compared to more utilitarian competitors. A refresh for 2010 brought subtle exterior updates including a revised front fascia with a larger five-point grille, improved interior materials, and added technology including a backup camera and blind spot monitoring system. The CX-7 emphasized driving enjoyment over maximum utility, reflecting Mazda's 'Zoom-Zoom' philosophy by offering more engaging handling and acceleration than typical crossovers of its time. Production ended after the 2012 model year as Mazda consolidated its crossover lineup around the more fuel-efficient CX-5 and larger CX-9 models."
